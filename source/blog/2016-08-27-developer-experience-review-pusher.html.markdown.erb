This is the second in a series of articles focussing on reviewing Developer Experience. Have a look at the first post reviewing SendGrid.

## Criteria

As with the previous post I will be looking at the developer onboarding experience with a focus on:

* **Flow:** How well does the product guide me from landing on their site all the way to making a first API call?
* **Exploration:** How easy is it to get an idea of how their product works before committing to a paid plan / signing up?
* **Completeness:** Once I have my first integration in place, how hard is it to find the full reference documentation?

## Pusher

> Build Apps, Not Infrastructure.

_"Pusher is a cloud-based tech platform enabling developers to create collaborative tools, multiplayer games, chat and real-time dashboards. Founded in 2010."_ - [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pusher)

I picked Pusher for similar reasons as my previous post: they are well established, have been very developer focussed for years, and they have a good reputation with developers in general.

## Next

That's it for this second post on Developer Experience. Let me know what you think of it and if I should continue. I'd also love to know who you think I should review next, and if you are interested in me reviewing your product then most definitely let me know!
